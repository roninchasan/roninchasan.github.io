    <p class='intro'>On this page, I've selected some of my best personal and class projects from each domain of programming that I have experience in. They are organized by category below. Each project card is linked to either a live iteration of the website (for web dev) or the full code on my GitHub (for data science and applications).</p>
    <div class='section' id="sec1">
        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>After creating static and dynamic web pages for a few years now, I've progressed towards more
            advanced work and now building web applications in JS frameworks. Below are a few of these projects, built from scratch with Vue.js, HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and SQL.</p>

                        <p>My first fully fleshed out web application, this project was a collaboration with 4 other students to gain experience developing a progressive web app prototype from scratch. We conducted numerous user interviews, followed industry UX/UI design principles, and I led the coding portion of development in Vue.js with Bootstrap. Optimized for mobile.</p>

                        <p>CUAB is a project team at Cornell whom a small group of other developers and I approached to remake their website. I, and three others, entirely recoded and redesigned the entire website, adding new CSS and JS features, including an embedded video gallery and a mobile dropdown menu.</p>

                        <p>Album Alley is a class project that I adapted into a personal project. It is a photo gallery of a small assortment of hip hop albums that is made functional with the use of an SQL database. It supports tag sorting, adding new albums, addings new tags to existing posts, and tag deletion.</p>

                        <p>In 2018, I redesigned the website for Magnatech from the ground up. In addition to redesigning the company logo and creating a 30th anniversary logo, I reconstructed the website through Wordpress. In doing so, I worked with the company on slimming down the amount of content on the site and redesigned every element of every page with Wordpress and some inserted custom code.</p>

                        <p>The Lift List was a quick project I created with class to help develop my SQL database skills and knowledge. This site is a list of weightlifting workouts stored in an SQLite database that is fully searchable. It also allows users to add their own workouts to the list.</p>

The page offers information about the festival and a number of photos taken by me at the festival, as well as a sample "sticky" form with PHP validation.</p>

        <h2>Data Science</h2>
        <p>Along the way, I've also picked up data science and supervised ML as skills. Working on projects from creating Jupyter notebooks with Python code to analyzing sensor data in real time using Java, I've gathered experience in both small and large projects of many different types over the years. Below are a couple examples.</p>

                        <h4>MLB Hitter Value Data Analysis</h4>
                        <p>This Python project is a full length data analysis of the worth of MLB players' attributes with regard to their salary, made in collaboration with other Cornell students for class. We sought to determine which, if any, MLB hitters' statistics or physical attributes were good predictors of salary in the 2016 season. We filtered and plotted our data, analyzed for linear, logistic, and clustered relationships, and determined the strength and confidence of each one.</p>

                        <h4>Wearble Golf Swing Analyzer</h4>
                        <p>This project uses Arduino to collect data from custom built wearable via Bluetooth. Calculations, analysis, and advice are made using Java Processing and presented in a webpage GUI. Uses a trained KNN (n=3) ML algorithm to identify type of club used in swing. 3D path of motion calculated using quaternion data from sensors to calculate movement of intercepting vectors in 3 dimensions and mapped using D3.js.</p>

        <h2>Application Programming</h2>
        <p>Lastly, below is a small subset of Python and Java applications that I have built (atop frameworks distributed by professors) in classes over the last few years. Having been making applications since about 2017, this is the area that I have the most experience in. Unfortunately, they cannot easily be run on a browser, so you will find the code for each of these projects linked to repositories on my GitHub below.</p>
        <h3>Java Projects</h3>

                        <h4>"Digger" Java Game</h4>
                        <p>This project is a game similar to the popular "Digger" franchise. The "digger" character must find the hidden coin (he is not aware of its location, as he hasn't "dug" close enough to see it yet), then collect as many coins as possible and exit the mine before his step count runs out. I coded the functionality of the game, which includes movement of digger, ability to find the hidden coin, collecting as many coins as possible, and finding a shortest path to the exit.</p>

                        <h4>"Bug Tracker" Application</h4>
                        <p>This Java application is a sort of epidemic simulator making use of the tree data type and recursion. Taking in a number of variables from the user, it makes a prediction about the number of survivors, immune, recovered, and deceased individuals in a population with a "bug" going around. I coded the parts that include the spreading of the bug through the tree and statistics about each node (person) and tree traversal.</p>

                        <p>A Python-backed iteration of the classic "Space Invaders" arcade game, with nearly all of the same features as the original. My partner and I coded nearly all of the functionality of the game, including states (pregame, in-game, game over), player movement, alien movement & waves, as well as laser shooting mechanisms.</p>
