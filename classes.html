                <p>Intermediate programming course where topics included object-oriented
                    programming (classes, objects, subclasses, types), graphical user interfaces, algorithm analysis
                    (asymptotic complexity, big "O" notation), recursion, testing, program correctness (loop invariants),
                    searching/sorting, data structures (lists, trees, stacks, queues, heaps, search trees, hash tables, graphs),
                    graph algorithms.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>INFO 2300 – Intermediate Design and Programming for the Web</h2>
                <p>The main emphasis in INFO 2300 was learning about server side processing. We began with a short overview of
                    PHP, then looked at interactions with databases, learning about querying via the database language SQL.
                    Through a succession of projects, we learned how to apply this understanding to
                    the creation of an interactive, data-driven site via PHP and the MYSQL database. Also touched upon were technologies
                    such as Javascript and Ajax and techniques to enhance security and privacy. Design and usability issues were
                    emphasized. </p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>INFO 3040 – Networks II: Market Design</h2>
                <p>Networks II builds on its prereq course, examining how the computing, economic, sociological and natural worlds are connected and how the structure of these connections affects these worlds. In this course, we construct mathematical models for and analyze networked settings, allowing us to both make predictions about behavior in such systems and reason about how to design such systems to exhibit some desirable behavior. Throughout, we draw on real-world examples, like social networks, peer-to-peer filesharing, Internet markets, blockchain, and crowdsourcing.</p>

                <h2>INFO 4240 – Designing Technology for Social Impact</h2>
                <p>This course, drew upon science & technology studies, technology design, and the arts to analyze the values
                    embodied in technology design and to design technologies to promote positive social impact. What social and
                    cultural values do technology designs consciously or unconsciously promote? To what degree can social impact be
                    "built into" a technology? How can we take social and cultural values into account in design?</p>
