        <p>Throughout my time in high school and at Cornell, I've taken a number of courses that have helped give
            me the skills and knowledge to get me where I am today. Below is a list and short description of some of these courses.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>INFO 2950 – Intro to Data Science</h2>
                <p>Taught basic mathematical methods for information science, with applications to data science.
                    Topics include discrete probability, Bayesian methods, graph theory, power law distributions, Markov models,
                    and hidden Markov models. Uses examples and applications from various areas of information science such as the
                    structure of the web, genomics, social networks, natural language processing, and signal processing. Coding skills
                    taught included creating statistical models using NumPy, reading/working with dataframes using Pandas, evaluating
                    models using SKLearn, and graphing using MatPlotLib.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>INFO 2300 – Intermediate Design and Programming for the Web</h2>
                <p>The main emphasis in INFO 2300 was learning about server side processing. We began with a short overview of
                    PHP, then looked at interactions with databases, learning about querying via the database language SQL.
                    Through a succession of projects, we learned how to apply this understanding to
                    the creation of an interactive, data-driven site via PHP and the MYSQL database. Also touched upon were technologies
                    such as Javascript and Ajax and techniques to enhance security and privacy. Design and usability issues were
                    emphasized. </p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>CS 2110 – Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures (with Java)</h2>
                <p>Intermediate programming course where topics included object-oriented
                    programming (classes, objects, subclasses, types), graphical user interfaces, algorithm analysis
                    (asymptotic complexity, big "O" notation), recursion, testing, program correctness (loop invariants),
                    searching/sorting, data structures (lists, trees, stacks, queues, heaps, search trees, hash tables, graphs),
                    graph algorithms.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>INFO 2040 – Networks</h2>
                <p>This interdisciplinary course examined network structures and how they matter in everyday life.
                    The course examined how each of the computing, economic, sociological and natural worlds are connected
                    and how the structure of these connections affects each of these worlds. Tools of graph theory and game
                    theory were taught and then used to analyze networks. Topics included the web, the small world phenomenon,
                    markets, neural networks, contagion, search and the evolution of networks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>INFO 1200 – Information Ethics, Law, and Policy</h2>
                <p>This course investigates the ethical, legal, and policy foundations of contemporary information technology.
                    Topics include telecom/network policy, big data, intellectual property, privacy, security, and freedom of speech/information.
                    Assignments included writing policy reccommendations, judicical case summaries, and weekly discussions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>INFO 4240 – Designing Technology for Social Impact</h2>
                <p>This course, drew upon science & technology studies, technology design, and the arts to analyze the values
                    embodied in technology design and to design technologies to promote positive social impact. What social and
                    cultural values do technology designs consciously or unconsciously promote? To what degree can social impact be
                    "built into" a technology? How can we take social and cultural values into account in design?</p>

                    explored concepts such as kinematics; Newton’s laws of motion, work, energy, and power; systems of particles and
                    linear momentum; rotation; oscillations; and gravitation. The electricity & magnetism section dove into concepts
                    such as electrostatics, conductors, capacitors and dielectrics, electric circuits, magnetic fields, and electromagnetism.
                    Both sections involved mathematics, graphing, calculus, and labratory experiments.
